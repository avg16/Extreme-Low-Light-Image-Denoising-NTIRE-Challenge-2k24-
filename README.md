Low-Light Image Denoiser
This repository contains the implementation of a low-light image enhancement model that was used in the NTIRE-2024 Low Light Image Enhancement competition.

Model Overview
This model is based on the ImageLab architecture, specifically tailored for low-light image enhancement. This architecture integrates several techniques to improve the image quality:

Spatial Information Enhancement: Improves the detail and structure of low-light images.
Intricate Feature Capture: Effectively captures detailed features in low-light conditions.
Multi-Scale Feature Refinement: Refines features at multiple scales for better image quality.
Effective Noise Suppression: Reduces noise while preserving important image details.
Performance
The enhanced images produced by this model achieved an average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) value of 24 dB on the training set.

Training Details
Training Platform: Kaggle Notebook
GPU Used: NVIDIA Tesla P100
Reference
The model architecture and training methodology are based on the research presented in the following paper:
